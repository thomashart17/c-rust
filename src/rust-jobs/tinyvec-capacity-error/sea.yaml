  # Rationale for the following option:
  #
  # 1. A tinyvec is initialized to type::default values on creation. In this
  # test we request a vector of size u16::max Thus a backing array is filled
  # with default elements upto requested size (u16::MAX ) . The way default
  # elements are added to the array is by looping one-by-one
  # (https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/Lokathor/tinyvec@350cf62/-/blob/src/array/const_generic_impl.rs?L21).
  #
  # Unrolling this big loop causes slowdown in VCGen and also CEX is very long.
  # For this test, we don't care about the initialization so we replace loop out
  # effects with non deterministic values. Loop inputs are not not touched. Thus
  # the input array is not initialized. This implies that reading from this
  # uninitialized array is UB.
  #
  # However, this is ok for the present use case because the property under
  # consideration is unaffected by intialization (we never read the backing
  # array). With the loop replaced by nd function, the verification is quicker
  # and CEX is manageable.
